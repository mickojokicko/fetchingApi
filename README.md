# Project: FetchingAPI

This project utilizes the JSON Placeholder API to fetch mock data. Once the data is retrieved, it is stored in local storage and displayed in a list on the user interface. Key functionalities of the project include:

- **Fetching Data:** By entering an ID number into the input field, the API retrieves data related to that ID.
- **Displaying Data:** The data is displayed in a list that includes user information.
- **Deleting Items:** Each item in the list has a delete button, allowing for the removal of that item from the list.

## How to Use:

1. Enter the desired ID into the input field.
2. Data will be fetched from the API, stored in local storage, and displayed on the screen.
3. Click the delete button to remove individual items from the list.
